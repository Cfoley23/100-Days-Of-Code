**Study materials used in the challenge**

1.) Udemy - 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021 (By Dr. Angela Yu, App Brewery)

2.) Practical Programming, Third Edition : An Introduction to Computer Science using Python 3.6 by Paul Gries, Jennifer Campbell, Jason Montojo

### Day 01: January 1, 2021
##### 

***Today's Progress:*** Finished Day 8(Functions and Parameters) and moved onto Day 9 (Dictionaries and Nesting) in the Udemy Course By Dr. Angela Yu.

**Thoughts:** Consistency is key in order to develop a deeper knowledge of programming. That is why I am committing to this 100 Day Code Challenge.

**Daily Work:** Caesar Cipher 5, Dictionary and Nesting, and student_scores in Day 01 directory


###Day 02: January 2, 2021


***Today's Progress:*** Completed Day 09 (Dictionaries and Nesting) and completed the blind_bidding program

**Thoughts:** Building on Dictionary knowledge from yesterday helped make this new challenge solution click in my head faster.

**Daily Work:** Here is a link to the work on repl.it for the blind bidding program I worked on today.

###Day 03: January 3, 2021


***Today's Progress:*** Learned about Functions with outputs today. Started to create a simple calculator.

**Thoughts:** Getting going on a problem is half the challenge. Finding the place to start on code is difficult. Getting more fluent in Python everyday.

**Daily Work:** Started working on a simple calculator app.

###Day 04: January 4, 2021


***Today's Progress:*** Read and followed along in "Practical Programming" up to page 57. 

**Thoughts:** Following along with a book is also a helpful, but different learning style. I think a blended approach will really cement the CS theory and Python language into my memory at a quicker pace. 

**Daily Work:** Followed along with small snippets of code in the built in PythonIDE just figuring out how the interpreter sees the code.
