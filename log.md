# 100 Days Of Code - Log
**Study materials used in the challenge**

1.) Udemy - 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021 (By Dr. Angela Yu, App Brewery)

2.) Practical Programming, Third Edition : An Introduction to Computer Science using Python 3.6 by Paul Gries, Jennifer Campbell, Jason Montojo

### Day 01: January 1, 2021
##### 

***Today's Progress:*** Finished Day 8(Functions and Parameters) and moved onto Day 9 (Dictionaries and Nesting) in the Udemy Course By Dr. Angela Yu.

**Thoughts:** Consistency is key in order to develop a deeper knowledge of programming. That is why I am committing to this 100 Day Code Challenge.

**Daily Work:** Caesar Cipher 5, Dictionary and Nesting, and student_scores in Day 01 directory


###Day 02: January 2, 2021


***Today's Progress:*** Completed Day 09 (Dictionaries and Nesting) and completed the blind_bidding program

**Thoughts:** Building on Dictionary knowledge from yesterday helped make this new challenge solution click in my head faster.

**Daily Work:** Here is a link to the work on repl.it for the blind bidding program I worked on today.

###Day 03: January 3, 2021


***Today's Progress:*** Learned about Functions with outputs today. Started to create a simple calculator.

**Thoughts:** Getting going on a problem is half the challenge. Finding the place to start on code is difficult. Getting more fluent in Python everyday.

**Daily Work:** Started working on a simple calculator app.

###Day 04: January 4, 2021


***Today's Progress:*** Read and followed along in "Practical Programming" up to page 57. 

**Thoughts:** Following along with a book is also a helpful, but different learning style. I think a blended approach will really cement the CS theory and Python language into my memory at a quicker pace. 

**Daily Work:** Followed along with small snippets of code in the built in PythonIDE just figuring out how the interpreter sees the code. 

###Day 05: January 5, 2021


***Today's Progress:*** Worked on a few further implements in a simple calculator. Read from Practical Prgrammer while coding along on console. 

**Thoughts:** Been enjoying reading Pragmatic Programmer on the side to inspire me to "think like a programmer"

**Daily Work:** Updated calc file in Day 03

###Day 06: January 6, 2021

***Today's Progress:*** Worked on implementing different ways of parsing comments on a reddit bot. Learned how to use the PRAW module a little further.

**Thoughts:** There is so much to do and explore while learning programming. I have started a "pet project", and while it may be small, it's a start to bigger and better projects. 

**Daily Work:** Reddit bot's meager beginnings

###Day 07: January 7, 2021

***Today's Progress:*** Was able to play around with some Scratch with my son today, figuring out how the built-in functions worked.
I read from Computer Science Distilled, a few chapters. Interesting and easy way to look at CS that I can get behind for an intro book into the topic. 
Fixed a bug in the calculator app.

**Thoughts:** As I learn about CS the more of the programming concepts make sense. Which, makes sense. :)   

**Daily Work:** Worked on Scratch, creating a program that moves the default cat sprite around the page and added a background. 

###Day 08: January 8, 2021

***Today's Progress:*** Finished up calculator app from Day 03 on the udemy app. Moving onto a BlackJack program next. 

**Thoughts:** Harder today because the blackjack program was more of a self guided tutorial. 

**Daily Work:** Added the beginnings of the blackjack game, and the ascii art file for the logo.

###Day 09: January 9, 2021

***Today's Progress:*** Worked on the beginning part of a Blackjack program. Created flowcharts to help visualize the program. Also learn about pseudocode. 

**Thoughts:** Learning how to utilize flowcharts to visualize a program that you are trying to create is a really helpful tool. 

**Daily Work:** blackjack2.py added in Month 01 Directory

###Day 09: January 9, 2021

***Today's Progress:*** Finished up the Blackjack project. Took some time to figure out things. 

**Thoughts:** Without a plan in place, larger coding projects would be an absolute disaster. I can see why flowcharts are useful for everyone involved with a project.

**Daily Work:** blackjack2.py updated
