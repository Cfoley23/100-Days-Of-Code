```
```
2.) Practical Programming, Third Edition : An Introduction to Computer Science using Python 3.6 
    by Paul Gries, Jennifer Campbell, Jason Montojo
```
### Day 01: January 1, 2021
##### 

***Today's Progress:*** Finished Day 8(Functions and Parameters) and moved onto Day 9 (Dictionaries and Nesting) in 
the Udemy Course By Dr. Angela Yu.

**Thoughts:** Consistency is key in order to develop a deeper knowledge of programming. That is why I am committing 
to this 100 Day Code Challenge.

**Daily Work:** Caesar Cipher 5, Dictionary and Nesting, and student_scores in Day 01 directory

<a name="day-2"></a>

###Day 02: January 2, 2021


***Today's Progress:*** Completed Day 09 (Dictionaries and Nesting) and completed the blind_bidding program

**Thoughts:** Building on Dictionary knowledge from yesterday helped make this new challenge solution click in my 
head faster.

**Daily Work:** Here is a link to the work on repl.it for the blind bidding program I worked on today.

`https://repl.it/@Cfoley23/blindbidding#main.py`

<a name="day-3"></a>

###Day 03: January 3, 2021


***Today's Progress:*** Learned about Functions with outputs today. Started to create a simple calculator.

**Thoughts:** Getting going on a problem is half the challenge. Finding the place to start on code is difficult. 
Getting more fluent in Python everyday.

**Daily Work:** Started working on a simple calculator app.

<a name="day-4"></a>

###Day 04: January 4, 2021


***Today's Progress:*** Read and followed along in "Practical Programming" up to page 57. 

**Thoughts:** Following along with a book is also a helpful, but different learning style. I think a blended 
approach will really cement the CS theory and Python language into my memory at a quicker pace. 

**Daily Work:** Followed along with small snippets of code in the built in PythonIDE just figuring out how the 
interpreter sees the code. 

<a name="day-5"></a>

###Day 05: January 5, 2021


***Today's Progress:*** Worked on a few further implements in a simple calculator. Read from Practical Prgrammer 
while coding along on console. 

**Thoughts:** Been enjoying reading Pragmatic Programmer on the side to inspire me to "think like a programmer"

**Daily Work:** Updated calc file in Day 03

<a name="day-6"></a>

###Day 06: January 6, 2021

***Today's Progress:*** Worked on implementing different ways of parsing comments on a reddit bot. Learned how to 
use the PRAW module a little further.

**Thoughts:** There is so much to do and explore while learning programming. I have started a "pet project", 
and while it may be small, it's a start to bigger and better projects. 

**Daily Work:** The reddit bot got a basic log-in function implemented and comment parsing.

<a name="day-7"></a>

###Day 07: January 7, 2021

***Today's Progress:*** Was able to play around with some Scratch with my son today, figuring out how the built-in 
functions worked. I read from Computer Science Distilled, a few chapters. Interesting and easy way to look at CS that 
I can get behind for an intro book into the topic. Fixed a bug in the calculator app.

**Thoughts:** As I learn about CS the more of the programming concepts make sense. Which, makes sense. :)   

**Daily Work:** Worked on Scratch, creating a program that moves the default cat sprite around the page and added 
a background. 

<a name="day-8"></a>

###Day 08: January 8, 2021

***Today's Progress:*** Finished up calculator app from Day 03 on the udemy app. Moving onto a BlackJack program next. 

**Thoughts:** Harder today because the blackjack program was more of a self guided tutorial. 

**Daily Work:** Added the beginnings of the blackjack game, and the ascii art file for the logo.

<a name="day-9"></a>

###Day 09: January 9, 2021

***Today's Progress:*** Worked on the beginning part of a Blackjack program. Created flowcharts to help visualize 
the program. Also learn about pseudocode. 

**Thoughts:** Learning how to utilize flowcharts to visualize a program that you are trying to create is a really 
helpful tool. 

**Daily Work:** blackjack2.py added in Month 01 Directory

<a name="day-10"></a>

###Day 10: January 10, 2021

***Today's Progress:*** Finished up the Blackjack project. Took some time to figure out things. 

**Thoughts:** Without a plan in place, larger coding projects would be a disaster. I can see why flowcharts are 
useful for everyone involved with a project.

**Daily Work:** blackjack2.py updated 

<a name="day-11"></a>

###Day 11: January 11, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Learned about Global and Local Variables. Worked on number guessing game using learned concepts.

**Thoughts:** Taking a break once in a while to come back to a problem with a fresh set of eyes is important. 
Set reminders to get up and take breaks frequently throughout the day.

**Daily Work:**  added to the log.md and added a couple of files in Month 01->Day 05 directory 
(number_guessing_game.py, art.py)

<a name="day-12"></a>

###Day 12: January 12, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Dove into the world of open source. It is vast and full of so many types of software to 
contribute to. Once I gain more knowledge on programming syntax in general I will dive back into open source. 

**Thoughts:** Open source would be a great way to connect with other developers and build a network as a new developer.

**Daily Work:**  Started working on a higher_lower.py game today added it to Day 12/Week 02.

<a name="day-13"></a>

###Day 13: January 13, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Worked on understanding the logic behind the higher_lower.py game I have been tasked to do in 
the Udemy course by Angela Yu. Really great course that I am learning and being challenged on. 

**Thoughts:** Taking breaks is important. Routine is important, but doesn't define 'productive' work. Staying committed 
to the solution is 90% getting there.

**Daily Work:**  Worked on higher_lower.py in Week 02/Day 12

<a name="day-14"></a>

###Day 14: January 14, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Started working on a Coffee Machine program within a given set of specs. From Udemy course ^

**Thoughts:** There are many different ways to make a solution work within code. Finding the most precise
bug free code is definitely something to strive for. I can see why coding can be considered a creative profession.
There are so many ways to express yourself through the solution.

**Daily Work:**  Added main.py to Day 14 directory

<a name="day-15"></a>

###Day 15: January 15, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Finished the Coffee Machine program with basic functionalities. Tomorrow will tackle the same
project but with OOP. 

**Thoughts:** Was a challenge but it is getting easier to see some solutions in code instead of looking everything up.

**Daily Work:**  main.py was updated with the last of the work on the Coffee Machine.

<a name="day-16"></a>

###Day 16: January 16, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Learned about OOP. Played around in the Turtle module. Named my Class object Timmy the Turtle.

**Thoughts:** OOP is useful to not re-write chunks of commonly used code. Saves time, creates a more modular system.

**Daily Work:**  small main.py file in Day 16 with work on the turtle module. 

<a name="day-17"></a>

###Day 17: January 17, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Worked on re-writing the coffee machine in OOP. Learned more about how OOP can be powerful and 
quick when it comes to re-using code in modules to then piece together software faster.

**Thoughts:** OOP is the buzzword I've heard about in coding. Not new, but still mostly the dominant style ATM.

**Daily Work:**  Uploaded the OOP coffee machine to Day 16

<a name="day-18"></a>

###Day 18: January 18, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Working on understanding Classes, Attributes and Methods in Python. Did some small coding
exercises to illustrate the concepts. 

**Thoughts:** OOP is just another way of approaching a problem in a more modular way. Why re-invent the wheel if 
you don't have to?

**Daily Work:** Uploaded the starting files and support files for the Day 17 project which is a Quiz Game. Began 
working on the project.

<a name="day-19"></a>

###Day 19: January 19, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Worked on OOP further by finishing the quiz_game from the previous day. Also started working on
the Turtle module a little more in-depth. 

**Thoughts:** OOP is easy to modularize, and then use small bits for other projects. Or change the way the code works by 
changing a few lines rather than re-factoring the whole project.

**Daily Work:**  Finished the quiz game on Day 17. Uploaded it to the Day 17 file in the Week 03 directory.

<a name="day-20"></a>

###Day 20: January 20, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  More work with the turtle module. Made a lot of progress in the realm of understanding the 
documentation a lot more than previous modules. Things clicked faster. 

**Thoughts:** Repetition is key, two days in a row working on the turtle module has really reinforced my knowledge on 
module, and in the knowledge I have gained in regards to coding in general. Fun lesson today!

**Daily Work:**  Messed around a bunch with files in Day 17. Deleted and reformatted to make "digital art".

<a name="day-21"></a>

###Day 21: January 21, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  More Turtle work, made a turtle race with prompts and tells the winner of the input guess.

**Thoughts:** Turtle is, for me personally, a fast way to learn coding with the visual representation.

**Daily Work:**  Day 19 files added

<a name="day-22"></a>

###Day 22: January 22, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Finished the race in turtle. Moved onto making a snake game in the turtle library next.

**Thoughts:** What seems like a simple library, turtle, can be manipulated to perform much more complex tasks than 
drawing a picture.

**Daily Work:**  Uploaded the files in Day 20

<a name="day-23"></a>

###Day 23: January 23, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Worked a little further in the snake game by adding controls to the movement. Also read from
computer science distilled, which is turning out to be helpful in basic CS concepts. 

**Thoughts:** Enjoying the simplicity and power of OOP. Cuts down on time coding the same thing over and over again.

**Daily Work:**  worked on Day 20 main.py and snake.py

<a name="day-24"></a>

###Day 24: January 24, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Learned further into inheritance. Finished the snake(caterpillar game)

**Thoughts:** Introduced a little flair to the caterpillar game with randomized colors for the segments.

**Daily Work:**  snake game updated in Day 20

<a name="day-25"></a>

###Day 25: January 25, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Started work on a PONG clone I have rename PYPONG. Also messed around with with turtle.py
in the lib folder in python 3.8. 

**Thoughts:** Realized that this daily work is paying off. Reading through the turtle.py code and understanding *some*
of the things that were going on in there. 

**Daily Work:**  Created Day 25 directory and added a few files related to the PYPONG game.

<a name="day-26"></a>

###Day 26: January 26, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Finished the PYPONG game in Day 25 on the directory

**Thoughts:** Putting together the pieces of the game was challenging but rewarding. Took a little longer than expected.

**Daily Work:** main.py in Day 25 is complete as it's going to be at the moment. :) 

<a name="day-27"></a>

###Day 27: January 27, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Started and finished the Turtle crossing game in day 27

**Thoughts:** making the game design a little more interesting paid off for a simple game

**Daily Work:**  uploaded numerous files to Day 27

<a name="day-28"></a>

###Day 28: January 28, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Worked on random "art" generators in turtle. Created a spirograph, and then made
it randomized. 

**Thoughts:** The turtle library is capable of multiple types of visual tasks. 

**Daily Work:**  Uploaded to the Day 28 folder

<a name="day-29"></a>

###Day 29: January 29, 2021

***Today's Progress:*** Worked on and finished a mail merge project using the built-in open() function.  
Started working with Pandas, NumPy today too.

**Thoughts:** Simplifying vast amounts of data quickly with Pandas is easy once you dig into the documentation.
Just scratching the surface of this vast library.

**Daily Work:**  Uploaded to Day 28 and Day 29 today. 

<a name="day-30"></a>

###Day 30: January 30, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  PANDAS practice today. Learned how to manipulate the data in a .csv file with PANDAS.

**Thoughts:** The power of distilling data in PANDAS is very apparent after only brief usage. I can see why I've heard 
the name being mentioned many times online. 

**Daily Work:**  Began work on a U.S. States Map quiz game. Figured out how many squirrels were black, grey, and 
cinammon in Central Park in NY from a public data share website. Used a .csv file to parse through the data. 

<a name="day-31"></a>

###Day 31: January 31, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Used PANDAS and Turtle to complete the U.S. States Quiz game. It will now write the states that
were missed by the user to a .csv spreadsheet called "states_to_learn.csv"

**Thoughts:** Really fun to see how the different libraries play together to make something. 

**Daily Work:**  Completed the file upload to Day 29 in the project directory.

<a name="day-32"></a>

###Day 32: February 1, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Worked on list comprehension and different ways to implement it in code to refine and simplify
code.

**Thoughts:** List comprehension is definitely a concise way of coding that really cuts down on overall lines in a doc.

**Daily Work:**  list comprehension.py file added to Week 01 directory

<a name="day-32"></a>

###Day 32: February 1, 2021

###Day 38: February 7, 2021

***Today's Progress:***  Worked a little bit on the "Product Landing Page" on #freeCodeCamp, and completed a little of the #Python section. Also decided to begin on another small website to reinforce my understanding of #html and #css. 

**Thoughts:** Daily work will help to reinforce certain ideas, but memorizing all the terms isn't needed to become a 
good programmer.

**Daily Work:** Started making a small website to practice what I have learned so far.
